# The Turing Trust Data Analysis Project
* Company Overview: The Turing Trust aims to refurbish donated IT equipment by securely erasing data, installing educational software, and providing resources to those who need them to schools in Malawi.

* Purpose: To develop MongoDB queries to analyze over 20,000+ hardware erasure reports. By examining past records and trends in device erasure, I seek to optimize erasure processes, constituting a significant portion of the company's operations. 

* Tech Used:
  - Databases: MongoDB (NoSQL)
  - Data Formats: JSON
  - Visualization Tools: MongoDB Charts, R
  - Development Environments: Jupyter Notebooks, MongoDB Compass

## Folder Structure: 
1. Data: Instructions for accessing the data cluster as a database user (via connection IP address)
   - Contains Blancco data erasure reports saved in JSON format
3. MongoDB Queries: Jupyter Notebook files for data analysis, including queries written in Jupyter Notebook and/or MongoDB Compass
4. Visualizations: Data visualizations generated using MongoDB Charts or R.
